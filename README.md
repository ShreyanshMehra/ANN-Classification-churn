# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project is an end-to-end deep learning application to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model determines whether a customer is likely to exit a service based on various features such as geography, credit score, balance, etc.

# Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and irrelevant features

Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

Performed feature scaling for improved ANN performance

Labelled the target variable (Exited)

Modeling:

Built an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras

Trained the model on processed data using train-test split

Tuned architecture for optimal performance

Deployment:

Deployed the model using Streamlit with an interactive UI for real-time predictions

User can input customer details and get a prediction instantly

# Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Streamlit for deployment

ðŸ’¡ Outcome
This model helps businesses proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling them to take data-driven retention measures.
